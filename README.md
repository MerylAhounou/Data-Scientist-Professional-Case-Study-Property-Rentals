# Data-Scientist-Professional-Case-Study-Property-Rentals
Inn the Neighborhood is an online platform that allows people to rent out their properties for short stays.


The goal of this study is for Inn the Neighborhood's product manager to increase the percentage of people who come to the site and are interested in renting their home start using it. To do this, I needed to develop a model that predicts how much a person could earn by renting their property, while avoiding estimating prices with more than a $25 difference from the actual price, as this could discourage people.
